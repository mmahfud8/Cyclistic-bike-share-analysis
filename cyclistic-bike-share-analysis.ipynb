In this case study, you work for a\nfictional company, Cyclistic, along with some key team members. In order to answer the\nbusiness questions, follow the steps of the data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process,\nAnalyze, Share, and Act. Along the way, the Case Study Roadmap tables — including guiding\nquestions and key tasks — will help you stay on the right path.\n\n## SCENARIO\nYou are a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share\ncompany in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success\ndepends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to\nunderstand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these\ninsights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual\nmembers. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be\nbacked up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## INSTALLING PACKAGES AND LIBRARIES","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"library(tidyverse) #helps wrangle data\n# Use the conflicted package to manage conflicts\nlibrary(conflicted)","metadata":{"_uuid":"051d70d956493feee0c6d64651c6a088724dca2a","_execution_state":"idle","trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Set dplyr::filter and dplyr::lag as the default choices\nconflict_prefer(\"filter\", \"dplyr\")\nconflict_prefer(\"lag\", \"dplyr\")","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## STEP 1: COLLECT DATA","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# # Upload Divvy datasets (csv files) here\nq1_2019 <- read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/divvy-trips-2019-q1/Divvy_Trips_2019_Q1.csv\")\nq1_2020 <- read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/divvy-trips-2020-q1/Divvy_Trips_2020_Q1.csv\")","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## STEP 2: WRANGLE DATA AND COMBINE INTO A SINGLE FILE","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Compare column names each of the files\n# While the names don't have to be in the same order, they DO need to match perfectly before\n#we can use a command to join them into one file\ncolnames(q1_2019)\ncolnames(q1_2020)","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Rename columns to make them consistent with q1_2020 (as this will be the supposed going-forward table design for Divvy)\n(q1_2019 <- rename(q1_2019\n,ride_id = trip_id\n,rideable_type = bikeid\n,started_at = start_time\n,ended_at = end_time\n,start_station_name = from_station_name\n,start_station_id = from_station_id\n,end_station_name = to_station_name\n,end_station_id = to_station_id\n,member_casual = usertype\n))","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Inspect the dataframes and look for incongruencies\nstr(q1_2019)\nstr(q1_2020)","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Convert ride_id and rideable_type to character so that they can stack correctly\nq1_2019 <- mutate(q1_2019, ride_id = as.character(ride_id)\n,rideable_type = as.character(rideable_type))","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Stack individual quarter's data frames into one big data frame\nall_trips <- bind_rows(q1_2019, q1_2020)#, q3_2019)#, q4_2019, q1_2020)","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Remove lat, long, birthyear, and gender fields as this data was dropped beginning in 2020\nall_trips <- all_trips %>%\nselect(-c(start_lat, start_lng, end_lat, end_lng, birthyear, gender, \"tripduration\"))","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## STEP 3: CLEAN UP AND ADD DATA TO PREPARE FOR ANALYSIS","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Inspect the new table that has been created\ncolnames(all_trips) #List of column names\nnrow(all_trips) #How many rows are in data frame?\ndim(all_trips) #Dimensions of the data frame?\nhead(all_trips) #See the first 6 rows of data frame.
